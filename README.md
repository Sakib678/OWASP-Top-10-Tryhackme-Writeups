# OWASP Top 10 TryHackMe Writeups

This repository contains my writeups for all of the challenges within the OWASP Top 10 TryHackMe room.

Link to room: https://tryhackme.com/room/owasptop102021


### Each section includes:
- A breakdown of the vulnerability
- A real world example
- A completed TryHackMe challenge related
- Key takeaways and mitigations



The goal of this project is to reinforce my understanding of each vulnerability type through real world examples. I wanted to apply my theory and test each OWASP vulnerability using TryHackMe labs. 

###  Structure

Each folder/writeup in this repository corresponds to a specific OWASP Top 10 category (https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/):

| ID  | Name                                           | Status     |
|-----|------------------------------------------------|------------|
| A01 | Broken Access Control                         | ✅ Complete |
| A02 | Cryptographic Failures                        | ✅ Complete |
| A03 | Injection                                     | ✅ Complete |
| A04 | Insecure Design                               | ✅ Complete |
| A05 | Security Misconfiguration                     | ✅ Complete |
| A06 | Vulnerable and Outdated Components            | ✅ Complete |
| A07 | Identification and Authentication Failures    | ✅ Complete |
